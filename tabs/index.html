                        Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that's gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.</p>
                    <p class="tab-txt">Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century.[1] Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but they involve walking
                        long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.</p>
                    <p class="tab-txt">BASE jumping is the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, using a parachute to descend safely to the ground. "BASE" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennae
                        (referring to radio masts), spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).[1][2] Participants exit from a fixed object such as a cliff, and after an optional freefall delay, deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land. A popular form
                        of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping.</p>
                    <p class="tab-txt">Underwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment. Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths
                        and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration
                        of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done.</p>
